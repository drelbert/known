//Middleware and app.js 
How do I know which app.use line is the app logic that does the res?
Originally its the routes/index.js file in form generated when app was created

In original form, the anonymous function that runs this code
router.get ('/', function(req, res) 
    res.render('index', (title: 'Known'));
is really the controller
